## About

Hey All, my name is Robert Langford and I'm currently working in Managed Services as a Support Analyst while studying for my AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate certification. This website is going to be a location for me to get to grips with hosting and recording my various projects.

Office hulk nicely represents my outward nice calm professional life twinned with my internal passions for lifting heavy things in the Gym or hitting the heavy bag.
I enjoy pushing myself. Both my problem solving, analytical skills and pushing myself physically.
